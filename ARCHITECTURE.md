# Architecture

## Summary

STICKS exposes two execution layers:

- a canonical reviewer path based on the local runner and artifact wrappers;
- a provider-aware VM-backed realism path used for campaigns that need a
  concrete substrate, infrastructure checks, and measurement experiments.

The reviewer path is the primary reproducibility target. The VM-backed path is
also part of the supported architecture, but it remains a second execution tier
because backend behavior differs across operating systems.

Detailed current-vs-target execution notes live in
`docs/architecture/EXECUTION_MODEL.md`.

## Layer 1: Canonical Reviewer Path

The canonical path is:

```bash
./artifact/setup.sh
./artifact/run.sh
./artifact/validate.sh
```

This layer depends on Python and repository-local inputs only. It is the
smallest supported surface for reviewers and should be used for any claim about
baseline reproducibility unless the optional lab path has been revalidated in
the same checkout.

Core components:

- `artifact/`: reviewer-facing wrappers
- `scripts/run_campaign.py`: canonical campaign execution entry point
- `src/loaders/`: campaign and SUT loading
- `src/runners/`: orchestration and evidence generation
- `src/executors/`: technique realizations

## Layer 2: VM-Backed Realism Path

The repository also contains a canonical VM-backed execution contract for
substrate realism and network/service validation.

Core components:

- `scripts/run_lab_campaign.py`
- `scripts/up_lab.sh`
- `scripts/destroy_lab.sh`
- `lab/health_check.py`
- `lab/vagrant/`
- `multi_vm_manager_2vm.py`
- `caldera_manager.py`

Non-canonical root-level orchestration scripts may still exist for exploratory
author workflows, but they are not the reviewer-facing contract and should not
supersede the documented runner or artifact wrappers.

This layer is useful when a campaign requires a concrete attacker/target
substrate or when the paper needs additional infrastructure evidence.

## Provider Model

The VM-backed layer is provider-aware rather than provider-fixed.

Preferred defaults:

- Linux x86_64: `libvirt`
- macOS ARM64: `qemu`
- VirtualBox: optional where available and stable

Rationale:

- `libvirt` usually offers the most faithful private-network behavior on Linux.
- `qemu` is the practical backend for Apple Silicon, but it may ignore some
  Vagrant high-level network declarations.
- Reviewers should not be forced into a single host platform or hypervisor when
  the canonical smoke path does not require it.

Current macOS ARM64 note:

- In the current `vagrant-qemu` path used by this repository, Vagrant snapshots
  are not available.
- The supported acceleration path is an opt-in warm-lab workflow
  (`run_all_lab_campaign.py --reuse-lab` and
  `run_lab_campaign.py --assume-lab-running`) for development-only reuse of a
  compatible running lab.
- Reviewer-facing commands remain cold-start and teardown clean by default.

## Separation of Concerns

STICKS keeps four concerns separate:

1. Campaign definition: what the adversary does.
2. SUT profile: where it happens and which weaknesses are present.
3. Executor implementation: how a technique is materialized.
4. Evidence generation: what was observed and how fidelity is classified.

This separation is important for honest reporting:

- published corpus is not automatically equivalent to executable corpus;
- VM-backed realism is not automatically equivalent to reviewer reproducibility;
- backend-specific constraints must be measured rather than assumed.

## Execution Flow

Canonical flow:

1. Load campaign metadata from `data/campaigns/` or `campaigns/`.
2. Load the matching SUT profile from `data/sut_profiles/`.
3. Execute the campaign runner.
4. Write evidence to `release/evidence/`.
5. Generate paper-facing tables under `results/tables/`.

VM-backed realism flow:

1. Select provider based on host capabilities or explicit user choice.
2. Bring up only the VMs required by the SUT profile.
3. Validate substrate health.
4. Apply the SUT profile and deliberate weaknesses.
5. Execute the campaign through the canonical runner.
6. Refresh evidence summaries and corpus state.
7. Tear down the lab unless inspection was explicitly requested.

The canonical entry point for this path is:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_lab_campaign.py --campaign 0.c0011
```

## Current Integrity Rule

Reviewer-facing claims should be grounded in the canonical smoke path first.
VM-backed realism claims should be reported only when the same backend was
validated in the current environment through `scripts/run_lab_campaign.py` or
its equivalent command trace.
