# Infrastructure and SUT Automation Coverage

This report describes what the current public artifact can provision
automatically for each published campaign/SUT pair. It measures declared
infrastructure and configuration coverage, not historical completeness.

## Summary

- Published campaign/SUT pairs: `14`
- Pairs passing strict validation: `12`
- Campaigns with base weaknesses configured automatically: `14`
- Campaigns with step-conditioned overlays: `1`
- Campaigns with latest shipped evidence: `0`
- Campaigns with single target host: `14`
- Campaigns with multi-target host topology: `0`
- Campaigns with multi-VM runtime substrate: `14`

## Interpretation

The current public subset already provisions a multi-VM substrate for every published campaign, automatically applies base weaknesses for every declared SUT, and supports step-conditioned overlays when a campaign declares them.
At the same time, the published subset is still operationally conservative: all currently shipped campaign/SUT pairs use one target host even though the IaC path can resolve multiple declared runtime VMs.

## Validation Exceptions

- `0.apt41_dust_full`: Fidelity mismatch for T1490: campaign expects adapted, SUT expects inspired
- `0.c0013`: Fidelity mismatch for T1055: campaign expects adapted, SUT expects inspired
