# Environment Semantics Gap - ACM CCS Artifact

This directory contains the measurement and reproduction artifact for the paper on
the **environment semantics gap in structured CTI**. The main artifact claim is
not live offensive execution. It is that the released pipeline can recompute the
measured counts, regenerate the paper figures and tables, rebuild the manuscript,
and expose the audit files behind every reported result.

## Fastest Reproduction Path

In the packaged review artifact, the smoothest path is:

```bash
bash run_review_check.sh
```

From the workspace tree, the canonical equivalent is:

```bash
cd sticks/measurement/sut
bash release_check.sh
```

The wrapper/canonical flow:
- calls the canonical verifier at `sticks/measurement/sut/release_check.sh`,
- reruns the SUT measurement pipeline over the local ATT&CK/CAPEC/FiGHT bundles,
- regenerates TikZ data and traceability outputs,
- validates key numeric invariants and static manuscript tables,
- enforces bibliography and paper-directory hygiene,
- recompiles the paper.

On the current laptop-class development machine, the full check completes in about 40 seconds.

## Scope

The reviewer-facing artifact is intentionally measurement-only. It is designed
to support the paper's claims with the smallest practical surface:

- CTI bundle snapshots,
- the measurement pipeline,
- figure/traceability regeneration,
- manuscript rebuild and consistency checks.

The broader research workspace may also contain optional runtime or emulation
material, but that is **not required** to reproduce the measurements reported in
this paper and should not be part of the minimal review artifact.

## Status

Use `bash run_review_check.sh` from the packaged artifact root for the smoothest reviewer-facing validation flow, or `bash release_check.sh` from `sticks/measurement/sut` if you want the canonical script directly.
