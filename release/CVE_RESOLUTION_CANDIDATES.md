# CVE Resolution Candidates

This report is a deterministic downstream artifact extension. It does not
infer exploits, rebuild vendor products automatically, or change the core
paper claim about the current ATT&CK corpus.
It is not an exhaustive crawl of the `apt` or `pip` ecosystems either:
it only resolves the campaign-linked CVE slice already present in the
current ATT&CK-based artifact and then applies curated, source-backed
rules to that slice.

## Summary

- CVE-positive campaigns: `5`
- Campaign/CVE pairs: `8`
- Automatically supported candidate pairs: `1`
- Campaigns with any automatic candidate: `1`
- Direct ATT&CK target-product bindings: `0`
- Curated CVE-only bindings: `1`
- Appliance or enterprise-server pairs: `7`
- Open-package pairs (`apt/pip`-style scope): `1`
- Open-package campaigns (`apt/pip`-style scope): `1`
- Automatically supported `pip` pairs: `1`
- Automatically supported `apt` pairs: `0`

## Interpretation

The practical reading is conservative: campaign-linked CVEs are measurable,
but ATT&CK software links usually name attacker tooling instead of the
vulnerable target product. In the current public artifact, only one
campaign/CVE pair resolves to an automatically supported open-package
candidate: `ShadowRay / CVE-2023-48022 -> pip:ray`.
The current public artifact therefore demonstrates a deterministic `pip`
path, but no automatic `apt`-materialized campaign/CVE pair yet.

## Scope Reduction Readout

If the downstream system is intentionally narrowed to installable open-package ecosystems such as `pip` or `apt`, the automation problem becomes much simpler, but the current ATT&CK-linked campaign/CVE coverage also collapses.

- Open-package scope covers `1/8` campaign/CVE pairs in the current corpus slice.
- Open-package scope covers `1/5` CVE-positive campaigns in the current corpus slice.
This makes the package-ecosystem direction a strong next-step simplifier, but not a faithful replacement for the broader SUT measurement problem addressed by the current paper.

## Rule Provenance

Each pair-level rule is grounded in explicit source URLs shipped in
`data/cve_resolution_rules.yml`. For the current automatic path, the rule
combines public CVE metadata with package-ecosystem metadata rather than
guessing a vulnerable target product online.
